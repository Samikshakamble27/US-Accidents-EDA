#Exploring USA Car Accidents: A Comprehensive EDA

In this exploratory data analysis (EDA) project, I delve into a vast countrywide car accident dataset spanning 49 states of the USA. This rich dataset, collected from February 2016 to March 2023, has been meticulously curated using multiple APIs, harnessing real-time streaming traffic incident data. The sources include authoritative entities such as the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and road network sensors. With a staggering 7.7 million accident records, aim to uncover insights, patterns, and trends within this critical transportation safety domain, potentially paving the way for more informed decision-making and enhanced road safety measures.
